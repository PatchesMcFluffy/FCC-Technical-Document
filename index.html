          Lua was created as a light weight, high-level programming language to meet the increasing demand for software customization. Lua is also cross-platform due to the fact that it is interpreter is written in ANSI C. This allows developers to embed Lua via simple C API.
        </p>
        <P>
          Lua does a few things differently than most high-level languages.
          <ul>
            <li>Lua does not include complex features by default.</li>
            <li>Lua includes a set of mechanics to allow developers to add custom features to the language</li>
          </ul>

          The first thing anyone learning a programming language writes is the classic "Hello World!" program
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping with this tradition, this is how the "Hello World!" program is written in lua.
        </p>

          Variables is lua follow similar rules to other programming languages.
          <ul>
            <li>Variables are dynamically typed, there for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion">typecasting</a> is not required</li>
            <li>Variables do not need to be predefined before they can be used, and are initialized with a value of <code>nil</code></li>
            <li>Variables cannot begin with a digit</li>
            <li>Variables can be any combination of letters, underscores, and digits</li>
            <li>Variable are case sensitive ie: <code>Foo</code>, and <code>foo</code> are seperate and distinct variables</li>
            <li>Variables are global by default</li>
            <li>Local variables have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scoping">lexical scope</a> </li>

          Lua allows the declaration of local and global variables.
          Local variables are declared with the <code>local</code> prefix.
        </p>
        <pre>
          local foo = 2
        </pre>
        <P>
          Locally declared variables are scoped to the block they are declared in.
        </P>
        <pre>
          while foo<=bar do
            local bar = foo*2  --> scoped to the while loop
            print(bar)
            foo = foo + 1
            end
        </pre>
        <p>
          Global variables, like local variables, do not need to be declared in advance. You just need to assign them a value to create them. 
        </p>
        <pre>
          print(foo) --> value of foo is nil
          foo = 10
          print(foo) --> value of foo is 10
        </pre>
        <p>
          Variables can also be deleted by assigning them the value of nil
        </p>

      <header>For loops</header>
      <p>
        As with other programming languages, lua has several different types of loops. We will look at a few of the most common types of loops, and what their syntax looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>The for loop</h3>
        The for loop has two variants: the <i>numeric</i> for and the <i>generic</i> for.
        the numeric for loop has the following syntax:
      </p>
      <pre>
        for var=exp1,exp2,exp3 do
          something
        end
      </pre>
      <p>
        The loop executes <code>something</code> for each value of <code>var</code> starting with <code>exp1</code>, then <code>exp2</code>, using <code>exp3</code> as the step increment. The inclusion of a step value in the loop is optional. if a value is not present, lua will assume a value of 1 for the step value. A typical numeric for looks as follows:
      </p>
      <pre>
        for i=1,f(x) do print(i) end

        for i=10,1,-1 do print(i) end
      </pre>
      <p>
        There are a few things that you should keep in mind when writting for loops:
        <ul>
          <li>Lua evaluates all of the values once before the loop starts</li>
          <li>The control value <code>i</code> is a local variable decalred by the for loop, and only visible in side the loop</li>
          <li>You should <b>never</b> change the value of the control varaible. Doing</li>
        </ul>
          if you need to store the value of the control variable after the loop finishes. You must save it in another variable.
        <pre>
  local found = nil
    for i=1,a.n do
      if a[i] == value then
        found = i      --> save value of `i'
        break
    end
  end
  print(found)
        </pre> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Generic for loop</h3>
        In the example below we are printing all values of array <code>a</code>
      </p>
      <pre>
        for i,v in ipairs(a) do print(v) end
      </pre>
      <p>
        For each step is the above example, <code>i</code> gets an index while <code>v</code> gets the value associated with that index. A similar example of how to print all the keys of a table <code>t</code> would look like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
        for k in pairs(t) do print(k) end
      </pre>
